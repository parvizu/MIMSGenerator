Pontential improvements (add if you think of something more):
<ul>
<li> Upload images by users
<li> Tracking the traffic and shares of each meme
<li> View most popular/newest memes created
<li> Tagging
<li> Save in db (sqlite3) instead of shelve
<li> User access
<li> Report offensive memes
<li> Private memes
</ul>
